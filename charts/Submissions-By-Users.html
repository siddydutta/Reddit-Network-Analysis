Similar to this, there is a trading account. Both accounts are very important if it is to invest and hold shares and other securities for the long-term period. With a trading account, one can buy or sell shares, whereas a Demat account holds the shares in electronic form. Therefore, it is important to have a Demat account if you are planning to deal in the financial securities.\n\nIn simple words, we can say that a Demat account is not much different from a bank savings account. A Demat account is used to hold securities such as Equity Shares, IPO Shares, Bonds, Mutual Funds, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Government Bonds and so on while a bank savings account is used to hold cash.\n\nNow, there has been a lot of confusion having multiple Demat accounts for use. Many investors are confused over whether they can open second Demat account or not.

If someone will keenly observe the returns of the recent anomaly where the Indian benchmark has shoot up from the 24th March lows of 7,500 levels to a high of 11,700 and delivered 56% to the potential investors, one could easily bifurcate the returns derived from specialty chemical companies. The specialty chemicals manufacturing companies such as Aarti Industries, SRF, Deepak Nitrate, Galaxy Surfactants, JB Chemicals, Vinati Organics, Fine Organics and Sudarshan chemicals claims to make the investors who have invested in them rich as many of them have delivered more than 200% gains in a short span of time. Moreover, the recent listing of two specialty chemicals manufacturing based IPOs: Rossari Biotech and Chemcon specialty chemicals have seen massive response from the Dalal street and resulted into bumper listing. Some of the think tanks in the Indian market believe that investors have taken out the juice from these stocks and less room has left for them. However, the recent trend of easing dependency on single supplier, spur demand in the healthcare and wellness products and opportunities of outsourcing the domestic specialty chemicals to western companies is suggesting much room in the upcoming years.

Are you for real?", "selftext": "Investing in a developing country like India where foreign investors hunt for those stocks which could deliver stellar returns is not a new normal. The developing countries are equipped with those industries whose growth rate could not be restricted due to untapped potential which makes developing countries a sweet spot to bank upon. Developing countries invest heavily on infrastructure, telecom, heavy industries, IT sector and financial institutions and institutional investors leave no opportunity of channelizing funds into high growth stocks. Despite, the above-mentioned sectors have made a fortune for investors but investor\u2019s love for FMCGs is never seen faded.\n\nNo matter what kind of investor you are, which salary class you belong, which type of portfolio you want to build, inculcation of an FMCG stock into your portfolio is observed highly. Not only the rising markets are an opportunity where investors add an FMCG stock to make some quick bucks but FMCG stocks also act as defensives when markets flow through turbulent times. The major element which has influenced investors to \u2018gung ho\u2019 over FMCG stocks is their quick cash conversion cycle which has made them cash-rich companies and high dividend-yield stocks.

"selftext": "Hello r/InvestmentClub!\n\nZurevu here calling on all r/InvestmentClub subscribers who want to help run this subreddit.\n\nYou may not know this, but r/InvestmentClub was originally created more than 9 years ago to function as a virtual online investment club. At that time we tried to make do with voting on posts and comments to determine how many people were in favor/not in favor of a stock pitch. It did not work. But now that reddit has enabled poll posts, we can have actually proper voting on stock pitches. Hence, why I am reaching out to you all today.\n\nWe are in need of 2 or more new moderators. Specifically, we need somebody to manage the Google Sheet for our portfolio as well as somebody who is ***VERY*** knowledgeable about finance who can vet the pitches that we will eventually solicit from the community. Please let me know if you have one or both of these qualifications. Modding experience is not necessary, you can learn it on the job, although, if you do have experience, please mention it in your application.\n\nA couple caveats: You must be on reddit everyday and you must access reddit with a desktop or laptop. (The moderation tools do not work on mobile/apps.)\n\nFor your application, please either comment below or message the mods (do not do both) with the following information:\n\n1. The extent of your experience with/knowledge about investing (How long have you been investing? How did you learn about investing? Do you have a finance degree? Do you work or hope to work in a finance related position? etc.)\n2. ~~How long you have been a member of~~ r/InvestmentClub\n3. Have you ever been a member of an actual investment club? In what capacity?\n4. ~~Why you want to be a mod~~\n5. Your age\n6. Whether you are working or a student or both or neither\n7. How often you are on reddit. (Time of day and average duration of a single session.)\n8. Your time zone\n9. What other subreddits have you moderated? (Not a requirement for applying.)\n10. Do you want to manage the club's Google Sheets portfolio?\n11. Any other relevant information which you wish to share\n\nAgain, you cannot be a mod if you don't have a laptop/desktop and are not on reddit everyday.\n\nLet me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Thank you for reading this.\n\nEdit: If you\u2019re going to message me, please do it through the moderator messaging system. Do not message or chat with me directly. Thanks\n\nEdit 2: Link to message us mods: [https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/InvestmentClub](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/InvestmentClub)", "url":

Posting Here", "selftext": "Hello r/InvestmentClub!\n\nThe goal of this subreddit is to build a $10M virtual portfolio of stocks, based on value and growth investing, that have been chosen by this sub\u2019s members, and that outperforms both the S&amp;P 500 and Berkshire Hathaway. The first step on the path towards that goal was building up the moderation team, so I have added 6 people to the existing 2 member (me and Ilovedonutss) mod team. I have recruited a diverse and knowledgeable group of people, from self-taught to formally educated, and amateur/student to professional. I want to sincerely thank all who applied! I really appreciated having a number of potential mods to choose from.\n\nYour new mod team (in alphabetical order):\n\nu/chefanubis\n\nu/ietsistoptimist\n\nu/Ilovedonutss\n\nu/imorbust\n\nu/krisolch\n\nu/RamadamSteve\n\nu/ThaButtPlunga\n\nu/Zurevu\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ll let each mod introduce themselves:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/chefanubis\n\nHi everyone. I\u2019m a late-30s corporate Finance IT process manager at a big multinational. My main goal is to provide helpful feedback on pitches and handle configuration, automation, maintenance, and graphic design for the sub.\n\nIn my free time I mostly work out, train martial arts, cook (former chef), play videogames and do a lot of gardening around the house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/Ietsistoptimist\n\nu/ietsistoptimist ~~is in university and currently slammed with exams. He will introduce himself in a future post.~~ Edit: ietsistoptimist is no longer a member of the mod team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/Ilovedonutss\n\nHi all, I am 20 year old and studying at the VU Amsterdam. I have a passion for finance and have managed my own portfolio for a couple of years. I also run my own business which requires quite a lot of time. Investmentclub has the potential to be the biggest community-run stock portfolio in the world, the question is whether the wisdom of the people will provide outperformance or underperformance relative to the indexes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/Imorbust\n\nHi everyone. I\u2019m a mid-20s professional investment analyst at an NYC fund. My main goal is to provide helpful feedback on pitches, with the remainder of my time spent on the virtual portfolio. I\u2019ve worked in the industry for several years now and am happy to field any questions you might have about securing a role.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading sci-fi (big fan of the Culture series), working out, and eating delicious foods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/Krisolch\n\nI\u2019m 26 years old and work as a programmer for a company in the UK. Mainly here to vet pitches and investment ideas for the virtual portfolio. I\u2019ve been investing for 3+ years now and follow a value investing approach based on Aswath Damodaran\u2019s teachings. So far I\u2019ve handily beaten the S&amp;P 500 index and am slightly above the nasdaq with around 25 stocks in a lot of different sectors/industries and a portfolio of $400k. I first got into crypto and bought binance coin at $6 and later sold it at $6 after I learned about stocks (that would be worth over \u00a3700k today :(). I also mod r/ValueInvesting, r/Undervalued and r/UndervaluedStonks. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/RamadamSteve\n\nHi all, I am a 26 year old portfolio analyst for a global asset management firm and I\u2019m currently located in the UK. I have degrees in maths and finance and am currently studying for L2 of the CFA program. My duties as a mod on this sub will primarily consist of vetting investment pitches and aiding in the maintenance of the virtual portfolio. I have grown my portfolio three-fold over the past year mainly using options strategies and getting lucky with a few individual stocks (had 50k shares of SNDL with a $0.14 avg). In my free time I like to game, go to the gym or out for drinks with friends and of course manage my portfolio which is currently sitting just below the $100k milestone. Feel free to reach out to me for general career/CFA advice if you are thinking about entering the industry. Cheers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/ThaButtPlunga\n\nWhat\u2019s up Reddit!\n\nI'm a 29 yo PhD Candidate in Chemical Engineering at UConn (go Huskies!) researching and implementing AI methods in the Aerospace industry for improving fault prognostics and diagnostics. In what little spare time I have away from finishing up my degree, I enjoy lurking on reddit, playing video games and sports, and watching my favorite sports teams dominate (grew up in the Boston area). I am currently residing in Washington, D.C. in hopes of obtaining a job with NASA once I have finished my degree. In terms of investing, the pandemic is what brought me to the market so I have a pretty novice investing experience (only 1-2 years worth). My best performing stock was actually a penny stock ($TSNP/TSNPD/$HMBL) where I got in at $0.02 and it ran as high as \\~$1.85. My next best investments were $NIO, $MARK, $NOVN which I got in early on and ran with for a quick 2x-5x return. I haven't had too many bad investments just yet as I like to practice good risk management, but I have lost a decent amount of money in silly penny stocks ($100-$200 each) due to impatience, poor timing, OTC market manipulation/crashing, etc... This will be my first moderating experience and I'm excited to get started. I will be managing the portfolio spreadsheet of the subreddit and am open to any and all suggestions on how I can provide you with the best experience possible so never hesitate to reach out with questions or suggestions. Cheers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/Zurevu\n\nI founded r/InvestmentClub back in 2012. At that time there were no poll posts so we had to make do with voting on posts and comments to determine which stocks to invest in. I think our first and only investment was in Tesla, though I could be mistaken about that. Anyway, the sub quickly faded away and I left the mod team a few years ago. I recently rejoined because of reddit\u2019s new poll-type posts. I think it allows the sub to conduct proper votes on stock pitches. I will be a manager of the sub and leave the finance heavy lifting to others as I still consider myself to be a beginner.\n\nA little about me: I have a business degree and work for a multinational consumer goods company. I have been investing for 10 or more years. In the beginning it was individual stocks but now I am more of a buy and hold index investor. However, coincidentally and contrary to my preferred investment style, my best investment ever is Tesla which I invested in May of last year. It is now up 1,503%. I plan to hold on to it for many years. My worst investment is probably Transocean ($RIG); I sold it after it went close to zero.\n\nMy other passions besides reddit are hi-fi and going for walks while listening to podcasts/YouTube videos/audiobooks.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**New Posting Rules**\n\nWe\u2019ve decided to completely redo the posting rules. From now on only posts about companies in our portfolio and their competitors; general business, economic, and investing news; and well-known investing gurus will be allowed in the sub. This means that posts about random stocks not related to our portfolio will be banned. Also banned are stock analysis/due diligence posts since they are so closely related to pitches. Other topics that continue to be banned are: penny stocks, cryptocurrencies, technical analysis, requests from beginning investors, active trading, and low quality posts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What\u2019s Ahead For** r/InvestmentClub\n\nThe mod team is currently deciding how the sub will function, how the portfolio will be managed, and other details. Stay tuned for those updates!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any concerns, ideas, or suggestions, please let us know below or [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/InvestmentClub).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nZurevu and The Mod Team\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Created links to the user profile pages.\n\nEdit 2: Copy/pasted u/Ilovedonutss' introduction.\n\nEdit 3: ietsistoptimist is no longer a member of the mod team.", "url":

All members are welcome to submit pitches to the moderation team for vetting. If they meet the team\u2019s standards (with or without edits based on the team\u2019s suggestions) the OP will post their pitch to the subreddit. The pitch will be open to comments and Q&amp;A for a period of time (we don\u2019t know yet; let\u2019s see what kind of response the first pitch gets) before a poll will be posted asking the community whether or not to buy the stock. The required percentage of \u201cYes\u201d votes is 66.6% (this is based on a poll of the community). If the poll passes the threshold, 10% of our $10M funds will be invested in the stock. (We will figure out what to do after 10 investments when that time comes.) Only one stock will be up for consideration at a time.\n\nWe are purposely not being specific about what we expect in a pitch--we want to see what kinds of pitches we get. However, needless to say, the more in depth it is, the better.\n\nThis whole endeavor is an experiment so please bear with us as we go through this adjustment. I\u2019m sure there will be hiccups along the way. My hope is that this sub becomes a place to have serious and engaging discussions about specific stocks.

(31% of those who had not read the pitch voted Yes, while 69% voted No. On the other hand, among those who had read the pitch, 68% voted Yes and 32% voted No. The threshold for buying/shorting a stock is 66.66% Yes votes.) Only votes by those who had read the pitch were considered.\n\nWe will soon be creating our portfolio spreadsheet and will share it with the community when it is ready. In the meantime, please share your thoughts and experiences with anything related to the process of pitching and voting on stocks for our portfolio. We would especially like input from y'all on how to increase engagement by the community during the pitching process. (Honestly, we were disappointed and surprised by the lack of comments in the pitch post considering that there are 65k members here. How can we get the 70 people who voted No Opinion to take a stand one way or the other? If you're one of those people, why did you vote No Opinion?)\n\nAs always, we are accepting more pitches. If you would like to pitch a stock, please create a Google doc and share the link with the moderating team. All pitches must be vetted by the mods before being presented to the public.\n\nUntil next time, keep safe and keep researching stocks. \n\nThe voting results:
